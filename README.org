#+title: clumped-processing

See [[file:full_literal_workflow.org]] for the entire workflow! This is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming][literate programming]] example, where the code itself is surrounded by rich-text explanation.
If we need to run the workflow, we can [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Extracting-Source-Code.html#Extracting-Source-Code][~tangle~ the files]] to generate the ~_targets.R~ file as well as the ~R/functions.R~ file.

The required R packages for this workflow are:

- [[https://github.com/isoverse/clumpedr/][~clumpedr~ package]], install with ~devtools::install_github("isoverse/clumpedr")~
- some packages in the tidyverse. It's probably easiest to just install them all...
- readxl
- isoreader
- slider
