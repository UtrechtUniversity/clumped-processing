#+title: clumped-processing
[[https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/400205023][https://zenodo.org/badge/400205023.svg]]

This is processing code for the clumped isotope (\Delta_{47}) measurements made with the Thermo Fisher MAT 253 plus isotope ratio mass spectrometer with the Kiel IV automatic line, located in the Vening-Meineszbuilding B, for the Stratigraphy and Paleontology group at Earth Sciences, UU.

* ~targets~ explanation

Using the R-package [[https://wlandau.github.io/targets-manual/][targets]], we can run only those parts of the code that need to be updated. The basic structure is we first load the necessary libraries, then we define functions that do most of the work, and then a workflow of targets with function calls that ~targets~ analyses for inter-dependencies.

* Deployment

The workflow is deployed by [[https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/faculty-of-geosciences/about-the-faculty/organisation/faculty-office][GEO-ICT]] and runs on a Windows Virtual Machine that is located close to the rawdata drive of the Geolab.

This VM can read in the rawdata directly and synchronizes the metadata file and final output to the Clumped Isotope Teams OneDrive.

To run the code, log in to the VM, start RStudio and run ~targets::tar_make()~ from the command line.

* Dependencies

We use the [[https://www.r-project.org/][R programming language]] >4.1.0 (because we use the native pipe ~|>~ operator every now and then).

The required R packages for this workflow are:

- [[https://github.com/isoverse/clumpedr/][clumpedr]] :: install with ~devtools::install_github("isoverse/clumpedr")~ to do the generic clumped isotope calculations
- tidyverse :: It's probably easiest to just install them all...
  - dplyr :: data wrangling
  - readr :: reading/writing csv files, changing column types
  - purrr :: functional programming, never loop again
  - tibble :: better data.frames
  - lubridate :: work with dates and times
  - tidyr :: i.e. extract character column, nesting, pivoting
- readxl :: to read in our excel files with metadata changes
- qs :: for optimized cache of lists
- fst :: for optimized cache of data.frames and tibbles
- isoreader :: to read in the raw files
- slider :: for the rolling empirical transfer function (currently not preferred)
- targets :: for the cached reproducible pipeline workflow
- tidylog :: for neat log messages about dplyr verbs
